      description: "The three Fire signs of the zodiac are Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. While they all share the essential nature of the Fire element, they each express it in a slightly different way.",
  
      descriptionOne: "As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire (just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it.The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation.Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. Its representatives are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given tasks.Aries - the Flying Ram Guided by the story of the Golden Fleece, an Aries is ready to be the hero of the day, fly away and carry many endangered, powerless people on their back. The power of the ram is carried on his back, for he is the gold itself, shiny and attractive to those ready for betrayal. The story of glory that isn't easy to carry is in these two horns, and if this animal doesn't get shorn, allowing change and giving someone a warm sweater, they won't have much to receive from the world. Each Aries has a task to share their position, power, gold, or physical strength with other people willingly, or the energy will be stopped in its natural flow, fear will take over, and the process of giving and receiving will hold balance at zero.",
      descriptionTwo: "People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their `king of the jungle` status. Leo often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This makes them warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.Leo - the Lion in the Cave The story of the Lion always speaks of bravery. This is an animal fearless and impossible to challenge, hurt or destroy, their only weaknesses being fear and aggression towards those they confront. Living in a cave, a Lion always needs to have one, nesting and finding comfort in hard times. However, they should never stay there for long. With their head high, they have to face others with dignity and respect, never raising a voice, a hand, or a weapon, bravely walking through the forest they rule.",
      descriptionThree: "Curious and energetic, Sagittarius are the travelers of the zodiac. Their open mind and philosophical view motivate them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life. Sagittarius is an extrovert, always optimistic, full of enthusiasm, and ready for changes. This is a Sun sign of individuals who are often preoccupied with mental work, but when they find grounding, they show their ability to transform visions and thoughts into concrete actions and circumstances.Just like Aries and Leo, Sagittarius is a Fire sign, in search of ways to creatively color the world in their colors. Clear about their intentions and honest by moral imperative, its representatives are often honest to the point of absurd, with no regard for tact and emotions of other people whatsoever. It is important for them to learn how to express their opinions in a tolerant and socially acceptable way.Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the largest planet of the Solar system and the greatest beneficent giant in Astrology. Their enthusiasm has no boundaries, and these people possess a great sense of humor accompanied by intense curiosity. In need of absolute freedom, their adventurous spirit takes them from one end of the world to the other, exploring different cultures and philosophies.Sagittarius – the Misunderstood Healer Guided by the centaurs and the story of Chiron, Sagittarius is the sign of teaching and healing, always ready to accommodate a friend and help others heal. This is a benefactor who is rarely fully accepted by common people, always in search for great distances where they might find a home. Pain is often hidden behind their smile, and they would gladly give everything they have to other people only to live their lives free from it. Blessed by many incredible things, there always seems to be something missing to make their life complete.",

      description: "Have you ever wondered what Gemini, Libra and Aquarius all have in common? The answer is they’re all AIR signs of course. Air is a rather elusive element that is sometimes forgotten about due to the fact that it can’t be seen… but that doesn’t make its presence any less significant. And just like its role in the physical world, air has a great deal of importance in the astrological realm too and those that are born under an air sign are known for possessing many distinctive traits and characteristics.",

      description: "The energy of the Water element, and the traits of Water signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Water quenches the thirst of every life form whether plant or animal. It cleanses and purifies. Most of our planet consists of water. Our bodies are primarily water. It’s the stuff tears are made of. Even life giving blood is mostly water. Astrologically, the element of Water exemplifies the variety of bottomless emotion and feeling responses we’re capable of. The feeling nature is at least partly unconscious, and that’s a vital piece of information to help us understand the Water element. What’s interesting about the Water signs are that all of them have an acute awareness of the potency behind the unconscious while also being primarily driven by what they, themselves, are unconscious of.",
