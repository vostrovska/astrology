      description: "Have you ever wondered what Gemini, Libra and Aquarius all have in common? The answer is they’re all AIR signs of course. Air is a rather elusive element that is sometimes forgotten about due to the fact that it can’t be seen… but that doesn’t make its presence any less significant. And just like its role in the physical world, air has a great deal of importance in the astrological realm too and those that are born under an air sign are known for possessing many distinctive traits and characteristics.",

      description: "The energy of the Water element, and the traits of Water signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Water quenches the thirst of every life form whether plant or animal. It cleanses and purifies. Most of our planet consists of water. Our bodies are primarily water. It’s the stuff tears are made of. Even life giving blood is mostly water. Astrologically, the element of Water exemplifies the variety of bottomless emotion and feeling responses we’re capable of. The feeling nature is at least partly unconscious, and that’s a vital piece of information to help us understand the Water element. What’s interesting about the Water signs are that all of them have an acute awareness of the potency behind the unconscious while also being primarily driven by what they, themselves, are unconscious of.",
